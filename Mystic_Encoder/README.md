# Mystic Encoder

This script can be used to Encode & Decode any file/text .
---------------------------------------------------------

Suppose you have to store a secret Nuclear fusion formula but are scared that what if that file get shared.
You do not want your secret keys, credentials to be exploited by any evil soul.

So to protect the world, you use Mystic Encoder.

Mystic Encoder script can convert any text based file into a encoding file that cannot be recovered other than itself, **Mystic Encode**.

### Features of Mystic Encoder
1. Convert any text based file into an encoding.
2. Convert any encoding into its actual text.


### Ninja Trick
You can be evil too !!
You can recursively encode a already encoded file. So the final file you carrying will actually be a encoded version of a encoded file. [Nerd-alert]


## WARNING !!!
Mystic Encoder can convert any plain file - text-file, python-file, javascript-file... any file... infact even this file.. it can convert even this README.md file


## How to use this super weapon ??
Follow the below instructions carefully.

This scripts take 3 arguments: Operation-to-perform, key, input_file_path, output_file_path

> Operation-to-perform: Encode/Decode

> key: Key is a special parameter that makes your encoding secure.

>     When encoding: value between 0-100

>     When decoding: 0

> input_file_name: File path including file name on which you want to perform encoding or decoding. 

> Output_file: Resultant file path with file name where the file will be created dynamically.

Command that you should be using.
```
python Mystic_Encoder.py operation key input_file_path output_file_path
```
